**App Description:**  
A Node.js/Express.js/MongoDB application for managing and discovering recipes. The application uses the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) to search for recipes and allows users to save their favorite recipes and create their own. Users can search for recipes by keyword or by ingredients, view details, and manage a list of saved and custom recipes. The app features a modern React frontend with Material UI, and all data is stored in MongoDB. **THIS IS A “GLOBAL” MANAGER AND NOT USER-BASED.**
